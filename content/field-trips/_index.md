In total, 10 field trips will be organised: five on day 2, and another 5 on day 3. Each participant will be able to register for two trips. On the final day, participants will join the 4 field-trip reporting sessions, for presentation and further discussion of the field trips.

Repetition of field trips is not possible. As they include the participation of activists, informants, specific venues etc, we cannot bind all of them to be available for two or more days. We are considering of including in the field trips issues of social reproduction as you suggest, and weâ€™ll come back with more details on this.
