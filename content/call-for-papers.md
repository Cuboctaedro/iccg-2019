The theme of the conference “In Permanent Crisis? Seeking (or Imagining? or The horizon of?) radical praxis in times of uneven development and everywhere war” seeks to elaborate on the structural relations, materialities and cultures of uneven development and everywhere war, (a term borrowed from Derek Gregory), which bring about the condition of permanent crisis we find ourselves in the world over. Building on the previous ICCG 2015 conference, we regard “permanent crisis” as a regime that needs to be radically challenged in both political and theoretical terms, in our everyday lives as well as in the host of global, national and local institutions that reproduce it. We therefore want to invoke again the notion of praxis as the realisation of collective thinking and acting that is required in order to remake (change?) the world.
