20:30-24:00 Dinner and PartyProgram sections explained:
```

```
Plenaries: will be open to the public and will involve a discussion among 5 or 6 invited participants, from Greece and abroad, who have extensive scholarly and/or activist experience on the topic under consideration. We have decided to use plenaries instead of keynotes, both in order to promote more collective and dialogic knowledge practices, as well as to avoid reproducing celebrity-style academicism.
```

```
Parallel sessions: will be open to the public. Each session will include four papers and discussion. Parallel sessions can either be organised based on different conference sub-themes, or host specific panels proposed by participants. If possible, we would like to keep parallel sessions to maximum 6 in each slot, in order to avoid information overload.
```

```
Field Trips: will be open to participants only. Depending on location, field trips will either involve walking or traveling by bus to specific sites. Field Trips will be lead by different ‘experts’ on the topic and/or area in question, and where possible will also involve local stakeholders and activists. Field trips will be round up with group discussions at different venues in the respective areas. Each field trip will appoint a ‘field trip discussant’ who will summarise the trip at the Fieldtrip Reporting Sessions.
```

```
Field Trip Reporting Sessions: will be open to participants only. Field Trip discussants participants will join dedicated discussion groups, where they will present summaries & photos of the experience, in order to allow other conference participants to get an idea about the topic.
```
